# RETROSPECTIVE (Team 02)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 2 vs 3
- Total points committed vs. done: 26 vs 34
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 85h vs 85h 30m

**Remember** A story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed statistics

| Story                                          | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _Uncategorized_                                | 13      | -      | 4d 5h    | 4d 7h 20m    |
| Point selection on the map                     | 9       | 13     | 1d 2h      | 6h 45m     |
| Upload citizen report                          | 10      | 5      | 2d 30m       | 2d 6h 15m       |
| Approve or reject reports by municipal officer | 8       | 5      | 2d 4h 30m    | 1d 7h 25m        |
\
> story `Uncategorized` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|            | Mean  | StDev |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| Estimation |  |  |
| Actual     |  |  |

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1

$$\frac{\sum_i \text{spent}_{task_i}}{\sum_i \text{estimation}_{task_i}} - 1 =  = \%$$

**Result:** The total estimation error is **%**, which means that the effective work required about 12% less time, compared to what was estimated.

- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n

$$\frac{1}{}\sum_{i=1}^{} \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_{task_i}}-1 \right| \approx \%$$

**Meaning:** The average absolute error per single task is **%**, which tells us that, on average, every single esteem deviated from the effective value of about 33.9%. Such a value is higher than the total error (-12%) because some errors have compensated each other (some esteems were too high, others too low).

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated - ``
  - Total hours spent - ``
  - Nr of automated unit test cases - ``
  - Coverage - ``
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated - ``
  - Total hours spent - ``
  - Nr of test cases - ``
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated - ``
  - Total hours spent - ``

## ASSESSMENT

- What did go wrong in the sprint?

  > 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  > 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > 

  >

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

  > 
  > 

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  > 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
